  The second season of Homicide:
  Life on the Street, a US police drama TV series, originally aired
  in the US in January 1994. Low ratings during the first season
  meant NBC ordered only four episodes before deciding whether
  to renew the show. The original cast returned for this season,
  the last to include Jon Polito.
